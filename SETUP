The proper setup for the project is:

$HOME/<whatever>
|
---bin
---pkg
---src
   |
   ---github.com
      |
      ---tellor-io
         |
         ---TellorMiner

The TellorMiner dir is generated by running "git clone https://github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner inside 
the $HOME/<whatever>/src/github.com/tellor-io directory 

Set GOPATH to $HOME/<whatever>
Set GOBIN to $HOME/<whatever>/bin 

Initial setup needs dependencies. Do this:
1) cd into $HOME/<whatever>/src/github.com/tellor-io/
2) run "go get -d ./TellorMiner"

Now you're ready to build/test

When building/testing, go into src/github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner and run "go test ./<package-to-test> -config=<path to config>
e.g.  go test -v ./tracker -config=C:/company/code/go/src/github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner/config.json
or to run
go run C:/company/code/go/src/github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner/main.go -config=C:/company/code/go/src/github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner/config.json
and it will test from there.


Now edit the config.json file with your private key, public key, and node_url (the rest are advanced options)
For running the file:

./runMain.sh -miner -dataServer

Note it will kick off both the miner and the database

To transfer tributes

go run ./main.go -transfer -to=<0x...toaddress....> -amount=<number of tributes>

e.g. go run ./main.go -transfer -to=0x2f51c4bf6b66634187214a695be6cdd344d4e9d1 -amount=100 -config=./config.json -psrPath=./psr2.json -logConfig=./loggingConfig.json

To deposit your stake initially (assuming you have 1000 Tributes)

go run ./main.go -deposit
