The proper setup for the project is:

$HOME/<whatever>
|
---bin
---pkg
---src
   |
   ---github.com
      |
      ---tellor-io
         |
         ---TellorMiner

The TellorMiner dir is generated by running "git clone https://github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner inside 
the $HOME/<whatever>/src/github.com/tellor-io directory 

Set GOPATH to $HOME/<whatever>
Set GOBIN to $HOME/<whatever>/bin 

Initial setup needs dependencies. Do this:
1) cd into $HOME/<whatever>/src/github.com/tellor-io/
2) run "go get -d ./TellorMiner"

Now you're ready to build/test

When building/testing, go into src/github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner and run "go test ./<package-to-test> -config=<path to config>
e.g.  go test -v ./tracker -config=C:/company/code/go/src/github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner/config.json
or to run
go run C:/company/code/go/src/github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner/main.go -config=C:/company/code/go/src/github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner/config.json
and it will test from there.
